CloudASP
========

In short, CloudASP is an ASP implementation for cloudfoundry.com, with MySQL as backend. This is implemented in a Java Servlet.
Only VBscript is supported.


System Requirements
-------------------

Any servlet container should do. Minimum memory for the VM is 128MB, but if you are going to create the next Facebook killer, you'll need more ;-).


Installation
------------

Visit cfasp.cloudfoundry.com for more info, and prebuild packages. These are the "asp_core.jar" sources.
